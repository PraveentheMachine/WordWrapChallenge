# WordWrap Challenge

### Description

The function should return the string, but with new lines ("\n") added to ensure that no line is longer than $length characters. Always wrap at word boundaries if possible, only break a word if it is longer than $length characters. When breaking at word boundaries, replace all the whitespace between the two words with a single newline character. Any unbroken whitespace should be left unchanged.

Please implement the function directly, rather than using any built-in function (for example the wordwrap() function in PHP). Please use PHP or any other programming language you are familiar with, e.g. JAVA, C#, JavaScript etc..

### Improvements/Thoughts

It was pretty fun I feel like there is an approach where I could pass through the message in one while loop however within a reasonable expected time
I could not seem to crack it without my code becoming increasingly more verbose and hacky.

### How to Run?
The easiest way would be to clone the repo and run/create your own test cases. You can also of course 
just extract out the method from the project 'Wrap Challenge'
